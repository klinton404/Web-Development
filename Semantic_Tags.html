        <summary>Bill Clinton</summary>
        William Jefferson Clinton (né Blythe; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician and lawyer who served as
        the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously
        served as the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979 and as the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981,
        and again from 1983 to 1992. Clinton, whose policies reflected a centrist "Third Way" political philosophy,
        became known as a New Democrat.

        Born and raised in Arkansas, Clinton graduated from Georgetown University in 1968, and later from Yale Law
        School, where he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to
        Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas
        governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National
        Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 election, defeating the incumbent Republican
        Party president George H. W. Bush, and the independent businessman Ross Perot. He became the first president to
        be born in the Baby Boomer generation and the youngest to serve two full terms.

        Clinton presided over the second longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[1] He
        signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
        but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological
        evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal
        Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial
        deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. In foreign
        policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton
        Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members
        joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation
        Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David
        Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.

        Clinton won re-election in the 1996 election, defeating Republican nominee Bob Dole and returning Reform Party
        nominee Ross Perot. In his second term, Clinton made use of permanent normal trade. Many of his second term
        accomplishments were overshadowed by the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, when it was revealed in early 1998 that he
        had been engaging in an eighteen month-long sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.[2] This
        scandal escalated during the year, culminating in December when Clinton was impeached by the House of
        Representatives, becoming the first U.S. president to be impeached since Andrew Johnson. The two impeachment
        articles that the House passed were centered around perjury and Clinton using the powers of the presidency to
        commit obstruction of justice. In January 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate, where he was
        acquitted two months later on both charges. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the
        Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus—the first and only such surplus since 1969.

        Clinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president. His presidency ranks
        among the middle to upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. His personal conduct and misconduct
        allegations have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved
        in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such
        as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations special envoy to
        Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton founded the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund with George W. Bush and
        Barack Obama. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016
        presidential campaigns. Following Jimmy Carter's death in December 2024, he is the earliest-serving living
        former U.S. president and the only living president to have served in the 20th century.[3
